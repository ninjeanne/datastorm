# Proposal
## Target Group
Agriculture

## Dataset
* Getting the data: Acquiring/gathering/downloading.
    * https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/land-based-station/global-historical-climatology-network-daily

## Problem Statement
* Work on defining problem itself and motivation for the analysis.
    * ELEMENTS=Temperature, Snowfall, Wind, Rain, Cloudiness, Fog
    * Trend of ELEMENTS over time
        * Relate them to extrem weather cases/ disasters
        * Impact on soil
    * Effect of surface on the ELEMENTS
        * Divide the data by regions (tropics vs. northern countries)
        * Which country is more affected by ELEMENTS compared to others

## Workflow
*  Algorithmic work: Work on the algorithms including integrating data mining and machine learning techniques.
    * ETL
    * Data analysis and evaluation
    * Data visualization
    * Bigness/parallelization

## Technologies
* ETL: Extract-Transform-Load work and cleaning the data set.
    * Spark
* Bigness/parallelization: Efficiency of the analysis on a cluster, and scalability to larger data sets.
    * AWS
* UI: User interface to the results, possibly including web or data exploration frontends
    * TODO ask Greg/ George
* Visualization: Visualization of analysis results
    * TODO ask Greg/ George
* Technologies: New technologies learned as part of doing the project.
    * TODO ask Greg/ George

## Team Collaboration
* Members: Karishma, Crystal, Jeanne
* Division of work
    * Out of the 6 elements (mentioned in our Project Statement), each one of us would analyze 2
* Version Control System: GitLab
